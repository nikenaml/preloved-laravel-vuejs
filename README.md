# preloved-laravel-vuejs
An application project built using the Laravel programming language as the backend and Vue JS for the frontend with a case study of making an online shop web system for buying and selling used goods.

- In this folder there are 2 different forder files, preloved-backend for backend files with Laravel, and preloved-vue for frontend files with VueJS, and preloved-html files for prototyping files with HTML and CSS.

- if you want to combine the two parts between laravel and vue js into one unified project, you can combine them by moving the "src" folder (which is in the preloved-vue folder) into the "resource" -> "js" folder (which are in the preloved-backend folder).
